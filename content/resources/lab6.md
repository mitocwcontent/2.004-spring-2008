description: "Lab assignment to investigate closed-loop control of the angular position\
  \ (\u03B8) of the rotational plant, investigate the manipulation of closed-loop\
  \ dynamic response through the use of derivative (D), and proportional and derivative\
  \ (PD) control, and to compare your experimental results with a Simulink digital\
  \ simulation."
