description: Lab assignment on construction and testing of an op-amp differential
  amplifier, use of the differential amplifier as a proportional velocity controller
  for the 2.004 rotational plant, measurement of the transient response characteristics,
  and the steady-state behavior of the closed-loop controller, and comparison of the
  measured performance with predictions based on the pre-lab exercise.
